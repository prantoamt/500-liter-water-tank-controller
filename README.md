# 500-liter-water-tank-controller
#### Arduino code for automatic water tank controller (500 liter). 

#### Why this device?
The water tanks used in our residential or industrial purpose needs to be refilled when it gets empty. Usually we refill water tanks by pump motors. When the tank/reservoir gets empty, we need to turn on the pump motor manually and again we need to turn off the pump motor manually when tank gets full. In this manual process, user always needs to be alert about the water level.
The main purpose of this device is to provide its users a hassle free experience. Just install the system once and you are good to go. The device monitors the water level inside your reservoir using Ultrasonic/Sonar sensor & then controls the water pump accordingly.
If the water reservoir becomes full, the device automatically turns the pump off and as the reservoir becomes empty it turns the pump back on. Additionally there are LED indicators to show the water level at different heights.
There is no need for any human interaction at all. Overall, it saves the users time, saves water by avoiding water overflow and protects the tank from running dry.

#### Features:
* Turns on the pump motor when water level is low
* Turns off the pump motor when water level is full
* Indicates the water level through 3 leds
